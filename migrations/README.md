To run migrations, please run from home directory:
`python migrations/migrations.py` 

Please note, the script will automatically upload log_information found in the migrations folder.

Any new log_information that needs to be uploaded by adding an argument to the migrations command i.e.
`python migrations/migrations.py -l /path/to/dir/log_information_november.csv`
